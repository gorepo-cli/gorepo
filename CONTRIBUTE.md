Juniors are also welcome to push code (see how we need to add tests, to add new commands, how error messages are hardcoded etc).

# Run the project

See [README.md](README.md)

# How it is built

For now the project is in a single file. I think we should break it only if we start having multiple contributions and we have templates and such significant features. Note that even if the project is in a single file, all side effects are injected to make every function testable.

# Test kit

Note there is a testkit that allows you to write unit tests for your feature.

I will add more on that here when needed.
